# DeFi Fullstack Project

This repository appears to contain a full-stack decentralized finance (DeFi) application.

*(Please add a more detailed description of your project here. What does it do? What problem does it solve?)*

## Project Structure

The project seems to be organized into two main parts:

* `/backend`: Likely contains the smart contracts (Solidity) and backend server logic (JavaScript/TypeScript).
* `/frontend`: Likely contains the user interface for interacting with the application (JavaScript/TypeScript).

## Technologies Used

Based on the repository's language statistics, the following technologies are likely used:

* **Smart Contracts:** Solidity
* **Backend:** JavaScript, TypeScript (Potentially Node.js)
* **Frontend:** JavaScript, TypeScript (Potentially a framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js)

*(It would be beneficial to list specific frameworks, libraries, and other important technologies used in each part of the project.)*

## Getting Started

*(This section should detail how to set up and run the project. Since this information wasn't available, I'm providing a generic template. Please replace it with your actual setup instructions.)*

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (specify version)
* npm or yarn
* A development wallet (e.g., MetaMask)
* (Any other necessary tools like Truffle, Hardhat, Foundry, etc.)


### Installation & Setup

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/nesnyx/defi-fullstack.git](https://github.com/nesnyx/defi-fullstack.git)
cd defi-fullstack
```


**2. Backend Setup:**

```bash
cd backend
npm install  or yarn install
# (Add any other specific setup steps for the backend, e.g., environment variables, contract compilation, and deployment)
# Example:
# cp .env.example .env
# npx hardhat compile
# npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

```

**3. Frontend Setup:**

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install # or yarn install
# (Add any other specific setup steps for the frontend, e.g., environment variables)
# Example:
# cp .env.example .env

```


Running the Application
1. Start the backend (if applicable):
```bash
cd backend
# (Command to start your backend server, e.g., npm run dev, npx hardhat node)
```


2. Start the frontend:
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm start # or yarn start
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or the appropriate port).
```

Usage
(Explain how to use the application. What are the main features? Are there any example workflows?)

Contributing
(If you are open to contributions, explain how others can contribute to your project. Include guidelines for pull requests, issue reporting, etc.)

License
(Specify the license for your project, e.g., MIT License. If you haven't chosen one, you might want to add one.)

Note to the repository owner: Please update this README with more specific details about your project's purpose, a more detailed breakdown of the technologies used, accurate setup and run instructions, and any other relevant information that would help users and potential contributors understand and use your project.
